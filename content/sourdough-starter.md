It, like, starts sourdough and shit. The whole process is easy; it just takes a couple weeks.

1. Measure, by weight, equal parts flour and water and combine.
    * For example, combine 100g and 100g water to produce 200g of starter.
    * This should be half the amount of starter you want to in total.
    * Avoid bleached flour. Using some wheat flour is good because it contains more yeast and bacteria to begin with.
2. Cover loosely and let rest 24 hours at room temperature (warm).
    * We're really only covering to keep out debris and fruit flies. Cheesecloth works great.
3. After 24 hours, stir the starter and incorporate  equal parts flour and water. This is a "feeding." Cover and let rest another 24 hours.
    * If you had 200g of starter, combine another 100g of water and 100g of flour to produce 400g of starter.
4. After 24 hours, discard half the starter and replace with well-combined equal parts flour and water.
    * **Do not miss feedings.**
5. Continue feeding another two or three days by discarding half and replacing.
6. Continue as before, but start feeding twice a day.
7. When it's ready, there will be a lot of activity (bubbles) within just a few hours of feeding. The starter will smell sour, but yeasty - not unpleasant.
    * Another test of readiness is dropping a small amount of starter gently in water. It should float, not sink.

Once ready, the starter should either be used immediately or placed in the fridge. Once placed in the fridge, remove at least once per month to feed for a few hours before placing back in the fridge.

Before using the starter, wake it up by feeding it and allowing it several hours to feed and get active (bubbly).
